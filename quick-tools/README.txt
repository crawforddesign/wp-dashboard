== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who can see the documentation? =

Only users with administrator privileges can view and edit documentation. This keeps internal information secure while providing helpful guidance to authorized users.

Yes! While the plugin comes with three default categories (Getting Started, Advanced, Troubleshooting), you can add, edit, or remove categories as needed through the WordPress admin.

= How many custom post types can I add to the dashboard? =

There's no limit to the number of custom post types you can select. The plugin will create dashboard widgets for each selected post type.

= Can I export my documentation to use on other sites? =

Absolutely! The Import/Export feature allows you to backup your documentation or transfer it to other sites running Quick Tools.

= Does this plugin affect my website's frontend performance? =

No. Quick Tools is purely an admin enhancement and has no impact on your website's frontend performance or appearance.
